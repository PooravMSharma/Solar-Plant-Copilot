# Solar Plant Copilot

Solar Plant Copilot is a Streamlit dashboard for solar plant operators. It combines:

- weather and solar feature extraction
- PV output simulation
- sliding-window time-series analysis
- local edge summarization with Ollama
- hybrid RAG retrieval with FAISS + BM25
- cloud reasoning with Groq-hosted LLMs

The app is designed to help operators review a zone's recent performance, compare it against historical patterns, and get concise action-oriented guidance.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Streamlit UI and top-level app entry point
- `pipeline.py` - Orchestrates the edge summary, retrieval, and cloud reasoning
- `data_extraction.py` - Downloads historical weather data from Open-Meteo
- `preprocessing.py` - Adds solar geometry and simulates plant output
- `time_series.py` - Builds sliding window statistics and residual features
- `edge_llm.py` - Prepares and summarizes window data with a local model
- `rag.py` - Builds and queries the hybrid retriever
- `location_manager.py` - Experimental first-run location bootstrap flow
- `config.py` - Central constants, thresholds, paths, and model settings
- `main.ipynb` - Notebook for exploration and experimentation
- `data/` - Generated CSVs and the FAISS index

## How It Works

1. `data_extraction.py` pulls hourly weather and solar data for each zone from Open-Meteo.
2. `preprocessing.py` computes solar zenith/elevation, filters daylight rows, and simulates AC output.
3. `time_series.py` creates 7-day sliding window summaries.
4. `rag.py` turns window summaries into documents and builds a FAISS + BM25 retriever.
5. `edge_llm.py` compresses the current window into a short local summary with Ollama.
6. `pipeline.py` combines the edge summary, retrieved history, and current metrics into a final reasoning prompt.
7. `app.py` renders the result in Streamlit and supports a simple operator chat experience.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- An active Groq API key
- Ollama installed locally if you want to run the edge summarizer
- The generated CSV files under `data/`

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages.

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly requests python-dotenv geopy pvlib scipy statsmodels ollama faiss-cpu langchain-groq langchain-core langchain-community langchain-huggingface langchain-classic
```

If you already have the environment set up, install only the missing packages.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

Optional values can be added if you want to customize model behavior, but the app reads its main settings from `config.py`.

## Data Files

The Streamlit app expects the generated datasets in `data/`:

- `all_zones_weather_combined.csv`
- `all_zones_weather_with_zenith.csv`
- `all_zones_daylight_only.csv`
- `all_zones_with_output.csv`
- `all_zones_window_summaries.csv`
- `faiss_index/index.faiss`

Some zone-specific CSVs are also present for inspection and debugging.

## Running the Pipeline

If you want to rebuild the data products from scratch, run the scripts in this order:

```powershell
python data_extraction.py
python preprocessing.py
python time_series.py
python rag.py
```

That produces the CSV files and retrieval index used by the app.

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit dashboard with:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Then choose a zone, choose a window, and click Run Analysis.

## Notes

- The edge summarizer in `edge_llm.py` uses `ollama.chat`, so Ollama must be running locally for that step to work.
- The cloud reasoning step in `pipeline.py` uses Groq's ChatGroq integration.
- `location_manager.py` contains a newer location-bootstrap flow, but it is more experimental than the main app path.
- The notebook is useful for exploration, but the Streamlit app is the primary user-facing entry point.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Generate or refresh the data under `data/`.
2. Confirm your `.env` file contains `GROQ_API_KEY`.
3. Make sure Ollama is available if you want the edge summary step.
4. Launch `streamlit run app.py`.
